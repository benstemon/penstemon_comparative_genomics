## Overview
This readme is a work-in-progress. Java scripts and, more generally, pipeline conceptualization is forked from (https://bitbucket.org/HeidiLischer/refguideddenovoassembly_pipelines/src/master/)

The scripts perform the reference-guided de novo assembly, with modifications, using SPAdes as the main assembler. All scripts needed to perform the assembly are included within this repo.
