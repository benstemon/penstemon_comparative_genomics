### [Dot plots and synteny plots with reference-quality genomes](jcvi_dotplot_synteny/)

### [Reference-guided assembly pipeline for non-reference-quality genomes](refguided_denovo_assembly/)
This directory contains information to generate _Penstemon_ genome assemblies with short-read Illumina data, as well as performing liftover/comparative annotations for these genomes. The assembly pipeline is a modified version of the pipeline described in [Lischer & Shimizu 2017](https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-017-1911-6).
